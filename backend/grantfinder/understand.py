PROMPT = """You read text messages from small-business owners, artists and community organizers
who are looking for grants (free money, not loans). Extract what they are asking for.

Rules:
- intent: "grant_search" if they describe a business or project and want funding or grants;
  "greeting" for hello/start/thanks with no request; "other" for anything else, including loans,
  personal expenses with no business or project (rent, bills, debt, tuition, medical costs) and
  unrelated questions. A bare "I need money" / "any grants?" with no reason given is still
  "grant_search" (leave need, category and business_type empty).
- Write need, category, business_type and search_query in English, translating if the message is
  in another language.
- need: what the money is for, in a few words ("flower pots", "jerseys", "a food truck"). "" if unstated.
- category: the industry in 1-3 words ("nursery / horticulture", "youth sports", "food"). "" if the
  message does not say what the business does.
- business_type: what they are ("sole proprietor", "nonprofit", "small business", "farm"). "" if unstated.
- state: the US state they are in, as a 2-letter code. null if no place is given. Never guess.
- amount: dollars they want, as an integer ("$5k" -> 5000). null if no amount is given.
- audience: every group the OWNER says they belong to, using only these tags: black-owned,
  women-led, youth, faith-based, immigrant, veteran, lgbtq, rural, first-time,
  formerly-incarcerated, latino, asian, native-american, disability.
  Map what they say: Black/African American -> black-owned; woman/mother/Latina etc -> women-led for
  gender; Latino/Latina/Latinx/Hispanic or a Latin American origin (Mexican, Colombian...) -> latino;
  Asian American/AAPI or an Asian origin (Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, Indian, Filipino...) -> asian;
  Native/Indigenous/tribal/American Indian -> native-american; deaf/blind/disabled/wheelchair -> disability;
  age under 25 -> youth. Use "youth" when the business or program serves young people.
  Empty list if none is stated. Only use what the message says; never infer a group from a name.
- search_query: one plain sentence describing the grant they need, written the way a grant
  description would read ("Grants for Black-owned plant nurseries buying pots and soil"). Mention
  the audience groups in it. Used for search.
Use only what the message says. Do not invent details.
